## Rules of development

+ The world editor is a barebones enviroment. Features should take that into consideration. 
+ The expectation of users is that they are fimilar with both the game and the game file formats.
+ Little validation will take place. This is to allow freedom, and simplified operation.
+ Not every attribute of the mapfile needs to be editable or represented. Only the ones that most people would want or are expected to use.
+ Support of this editor isn't a priority, and isn't expected to ever be. The editor may be broken by any future change to Endless Sky's code. 
+Use at you own risk, but I doubt it'll halt and catch fire.
